# @chs/stow

TypeScript client for the [stow](https://github.com/chester-hill-solutions/stow) local S3-compatible dev bucket service.

## Install

```sh
npm install @chs/stow
```

Build the Go binary first when working from the monorepo:

```sh
make build
```

## Usage

```ts
import { Stow } from "@chs/stow";

const bucket = await Stow.start({
  dataDir: ".dev-bucket",
  buckets: ["uploads"],
  port: 0,
  backend: "filesystem",
});

process.env.S3_ENDPOINT = bucket.endpoint;
process.env.S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID = bucket.accessKeyId;
process.env.S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = bucket.secretAccessKey;

await bucket.stop();
```

`Stow.start()` owns the child process it launches. Use `backend: "memory"` for an explicitly ephemeral instance. To use an already-running endpoint, call `Stow.connect({ endpoint, accessKeyId, secretAccessKey, region })`; its connection is disconnected by the caller rather than by the managed-process `stop()` method. Both entry points remain endpoint-based in 0.2; the portable in-process/WASM API is a later additive profile.

Both connection helpers also accept an optional `sessionToken` or credential `provider` for temporary AWS credentials.

CLI equivalent:

```sh
stow serve --data-dir .dev-bucket --port 9000
```

## Binary resolution

1. `STOW_BIN` environment variable
2. `bin/stow` relative to the monorepo root (when developing in-repo)
3. `stow` on `PATH`

## Development

```sh
cd packages/stow
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

The package test suite includes lifecycle and shared-corpus coverage. Run `make build` before `npm test` when working from the monorepo.
